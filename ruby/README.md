## Project 1: Caesar Cipher

Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:
~~~ruby
  > caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
~~~

## Project 2: Stock Picker

Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
~~~ruby
  > stock_picker([17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10])
  => [1,4]  # for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
~~~
